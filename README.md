# Firebase Email Passwordless Link Authentication

This example creates an authentication system that uses a **signed and encrypted cookie to store session data**. It uses current best practices as for authentication in the Next.js ecosystem, we use **`useUser` custom hook**  together with [swr](https://swr.vercel.app/) for data fetching.
   
- Firebase Authentication with Email Passwordless Link is used to authenticate users.
- Session data is signed and encrypted in a cookie.
      
**iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are also delivered. The apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the apps through the [Expo Publish Link](https://expo.dev/@jglchen/firebase-auth-email) with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app.
